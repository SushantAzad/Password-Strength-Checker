          The Password Strength Checker evaluates passwords based on length, the inclusion of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It provides real-time feedback on the strength of your password, indicating whether it is very weak, weak, moderate, strong, or very strong.

          In addition to checking password strength, you can also compare your password against a list of commonly used passwords. If your password matches any entry in the list, it means your password is commonly used and could be easily cracked by attackers. Alternatively, you can upload your own wordlist to check against, or download the <a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Passwords" target="_blank">rockyou.txt</a> wordlist.
